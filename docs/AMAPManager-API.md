# AMAPManager API Documentation

## Overview
AMAPManager (Antifragile Maximization and Pattern Disruption) proactively identifies and disrupts suboptimal behavioral loops, stress-testing emergent patterns to make users antifragile.

---

## Constructor
```js
new AMAPManager({ fractalProcessor, statisticalProcessor, synthesisManager })
```
- `fractalProcessor`: Instance of FractalProcessor
- `statisticalProcessor`: Instance of StatisticalProcessor
- `synthesisManager`: Instance of NovelSynthesisManager

---

## Methods

### detectEntrapmentPattern(workflowData)
Detects if the user's workflow is repetitive and low-complexity.
- **Parameters:**
  - `workflowData`: Array of user actions or workflow metrics
- **Returns:** `Boolean` (true if entrapment detected)

### disruptPattern(workflowData, context)
Synthesizes and applies a disruptive intervention to break the loop.
- **Parameters:**
  - `workflowData`: Array of user actions or workflow metrics
  - `context`: Context string or object
- **Returns:** `Object` with disruption details and message

### stressTestPattern(newPattern, environment)
Increases environmental complexity and monitors adaptation.
- **Parameters:**
  - `newPattern`: The new behavioral pattern after disruption
  - `environment`: Environment object (should have a `complexity` property)
- **Returns:** `Object` with stress test results

## Integration in RIAEngine

- AMAPManager is instantiated in the RIAEngine constructor:
  ```js
  this.amapManager = new AMAPManager({
    fractalProcessor: this.mathCore.fractalProcessor,
    statisticalProcessor: this.mathCore.statisticalProcessor,
    synthesisManager: this.novelSynthesisManager
  });
  ```
- In `processDataPacket`, AMAPManager is used to:
  - Detect entrapment patterns
  - Disrupt them and stress-test the new pattern
  - Inject disruptive interventions into the main intervention flow

---

## Example Usage
```js
if (amapManager.detectEntrapmentPattern(workflow)) {
  const disruption = amapManager.disruptPattern(workflow, context);
  amapManager.stressTestPattern(disruption, environment);
}
```

---

## Notes
- AMAPManager is designed to be amoral and resource-efficient: it disrupts with minimal cost for maximal behavioral shift.
- It leverages fractal/statistical analysis for pattern detection and synthesis for intervention generation.
- Stress-testing ensures new patterns are robust and adaptable.
